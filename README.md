# Py_n_Ne 
AA 2018/2019) Python and Network class @IMT Lucca

The course intend to provide an introduction to programming in python. The application are going to be application to the analysis of complex networks.

## Structure of the course:
Lesson -1) Installation and why
   - Conda and virtual environments
   - Github
   - Jupyter Notebooks

Lesson 0) Basics:
   - Data type
   - Basic functions
   - Logical functions
   - List, tuple
   - Loops
   
Lesson 1) Still basics
   - Dictionaries
   - Function 
   - Files
   - Debugging: raise, try/except, asser
   
Lesson 2.0.0) Numpy:
   - numpy arrays and functions of numpy arrays
   - numpy arrays with structured data
   - load files/save files
   - obtain the adjacency matrix
   - calculate the degree sequence
   - calculate the clustering coefficient
   - save everything somewhere
   
Lesson 2.0.1) Numpy Random and Random Graphs
   - basic random submodule functions for the definition of a Random Graph/Configuration Model as benchmarks
   
Lesson 2.1) Pandas
   - extra
   
Lesson 3) Matplotlib 
   - Structure of a matplotlib plot
   - plots, scatters, histograms
   - legendary legends

Lesson 4) request and BeautifulSoup: how to get the data

   - examining the structure of a webpage
   - handling the exceptions

### A (FREE!) textbook to start with:
[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, by Al Sweigart](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)

### How to write in Markdown
[MarkDown quick guide](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link)  
[MarkDown long guide](https://markdown-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

### Conda
[Conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html)

### Repositories
They are changing their policy, but essentially [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/product) gives **free** private repository, but you have to pay for public ones. Instead, [GitHub](https://github.com/) does the opposite. They both use [git](https://git-scm.com/) for managing the repositories.

### Handling difficult situations with git
They are more than you can think about... Here is a [quick tutorial](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/numerous_undo_possibilities_in_git/), here you can fine an interesting [discussions on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44727750/how-do-i-restore-a-previous-version-as-a-new-commit-in-git), otherwise 
[GitHub itself tries to answer to possible issues](https://blog.github.com/2015-06-08-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git/). Anyway, when everything is messed up, pray your favorite divinity and try [this](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge).

### Jupyter
[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/index.html)  
[Jupyter guide](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)  
[Jupyter extensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions)  
[Jupyter configurator](https://github.com/Jupyter-contrib/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator)

### Networks
[NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/index.html)<br/> 
[python-igraph](http://igraph.org/python/) was not covered by the lectures, but really useful.

### Numpy, Scipy, Pandas
[Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/ "The best module ever")<br/>
We did not used it, but [Scipy](https://scipy.org/) is part of the family of Numpy and Pandas and has submodules of statistics, equation solvers among many others...<br/>
[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html#)

### Matplotlib
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/index.html "A nightmare")  
[Matplotlib plot structure](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/usage.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-introductory-usage-py "Something everyone should read more carefully every time")  
[Matplotlib colors maps](https://matplotlib.org/examples/color/colormaps_reference.html "Something soopercool!")

### Some tricks
The [Remote Notebook](https://coderwall.com/p/ohk6cg/remote-access-to-ipython-notebooks-via-ssh) guide teaches how to use a jupyter notebook remotely from a server.<br/>
[tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) is a cool way to have a progress bar in your loops<br/>
[Jupyter Widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Widget%20Basics.html) are cool, but sometimes it's more annoying fixing them than the beauty they add to your notebook.
